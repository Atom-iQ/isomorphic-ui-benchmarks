isomorphic-ui-benchmarks
========================================

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/marko-js/isomorphic-ui-benchmarks.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

This repo includes multiple benchmarks for various UI libraries. Each benchmark is designed to measure rendering performance (on the server and in the browser) and the time that it takes to update the DOM (client-side only).

# Additional details

## Included libraries

The following UI libraries are currently included:

- [inferno](https://github.com/infernojs/inferno)
- [marko](https://github.com/marko-js/marko)
- [preact](https://github.com/developit/preact)
- [react](https://github.com/facebook/react)
- [vue](https://github.com/vuejs/vue)

## Included benchmarks

This repo currently includes the following benchmarks

### Search Results

This benchmark measures the time it takes to render pages of search results. Each page includes 100 search result items. Every iteration renders an entirely new set of search results. As a result of rendering new search results for every cycle, a significant number of DOM nodes must be updated.

### Color Picker

This benchmark measures the time it takes to cycle through a selected color. The selected color index changes every cycle. When the selected color index changes two things happen:

- The new selected color is highlighted
- The old selected color is unhighlighted
- The selected color is shown at the end

Compared to the search results benchmark, there are a relatively small number of changes to the DOM for every cycle.

# Running the benchmarks
